### General Information

This project was to create a 3 - Tier Application.
This had to include
* WPF front end
* SQL database back end with at least two linked tables
* Use of Entity Framework to manage the model and database
* Business Layer with CRUD application and unit tests

The Planner Application WPF displays a Weekly Planner with a column for each day of the week. 
Ability to add activites that happen every week such as Work on weekdays 9-5.
Ability to add one of activities as well providing information about each activity.
Ability to delete and update planner as needed.

### Sprint 1

#### Sprint 1 Goal

Create a WPF Weekly Planner (Minimal Viable Product) 
Be able to put activities onto the planner 

#### Sprint 1 Review

#### Sprint 1 Retrospective 
* Pleased with how my first sprint went and first time creating a 3 - Tier App
* Next Sprint I need to make sure my User Stories are smaller, take on one task at a time
* Next Sprint I need to keep my code neat, make sure I'm using all tiers and not just re-writing code
* Next Sprint sort front end, TOO MUCH going on 
* Next Sprint need to take it step my step & take breaks so I have fresh eyes 
 
### Sprint 2

#### Sprint 2 Goal

Add an update function on the WPF
Make sure there are passing Unit Tests for the methods in the CRUD

#### Sprint  2 Review

#### Sprint 2 Retrospective 
* Made a lot more progress in the second sprint
* Following from Sprint 1 Retrospective 
  * Worked on making my user stories smaller and was able to add more functionality to GUI doing this, still more work to do on this so hoping for improvement Sprint 3
  * Sorted my GUI by splitting onto 3 windows
  * Ensured I had more breaks which helped solve problems faster
* Next Sprint I need to make sure I have a unit test for each method before moving on to the next method 

### Sprint 3

#### Sprint 3 Goal

Add a delete function 
Make sure there are passing Unit Tests for all the delete Methods in the CRUD Manager

Ensure the front end is easy to navigate


#### Sprint 3 Review

#### Sprint 3 Retrospective 
* Happy with completed MVP (minimal viable product) :
 * Functionality I set out to complete on GUI
 * Happy with GUI design
* Following from Sprint 2 Retrospective 
 * Completed Unit Tests as I created method this sprint
 * Continuted to think about User Stories and how to split them 
* Future work on the Planner Application (Seen in Project Backlog)
 * Add Functions which allow multiple users 
 * Following from above be able to add and delete users 
 * Add accessibility levels eg a toddler cannot edit their own planner, parent would do for them, parent can edit teenagers but teen can't edit their parents
 * Add more weeks so you can plan for the following weeks 
 * Add months/ years 
 
 #### Project Retrospective 
 * Need to add messages on the Commits explaing what they are adding/updating which User Story it completes
 * Work on breaking down user stories on focusing on making working methods, one at a time (adding unit test after finishing writing the method)
