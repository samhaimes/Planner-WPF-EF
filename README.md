### General Information

This project was to create a 3 - Tier Application.
This had to include
* WPF front end
* SQL database back end with at least two linked tables
* Use of Entity Framework to manage the model and database
* Business Layer with CRUD application and unit tests

The Planner Application WPF displays a Weekly Planner with a column for each day of the week
* Ability to add activites that happen every week such as Work on weekdays 9-5
* Ability to add one of activities as well providing information about each activity
* Ability to delete and update planner as needed

### Definition of Done

#### Project Definition of Done

* Working Application
* All unit tests passing
* All code working
* All acceptance criteria met
* All issues resolved 
* All code uploaded to GitHub

#### User Story Definition of Done

* Code for the functionally produced 
* User story met 
* Unit test written and passed
* Tested against acceptance criteria
* Project builds with no error

### Technologies

* SQL Server
* C#

### Sprint 1

#### Sprint 1 Goal

* Create a WPF Weekly Planner (Minimal Viable Product) 
* Be able to put activities onto the planner 

#### Sprint 1 Review
* Completed Items
 * Set up Project Board
 * Set up Visual Studio and Github Repo
 * Created initial user stories

* Complete User Stories
 * As a user I want to be able to select a list of my activites and add them to my planner

* Incomplete User Stories
 * As a User I want to add tasks to each day of the week so I can stay on track

#### Sprint 1 Retrospective 
* Pleased with how my first sprint went and first time creating a 3 - Tier App
* Next Sprint I need to make sure my User Stories are smaller, take on one task at a time
* Next Sprint I need to keep my code neat, make sure I'm using all tiers and not just re-writing code
* Next Sprint sort front end, TOO MUCH going on 
* Next Sprint need to take it step my step & take breaks so I have fresh eyes 
 
### Sprint 2

#### Sprint 2 Goal

* Add an update function on the WPF
* Make sure there are passing Unit Tests for the methods in the CRUD

#### Sprint  2 Review
* Completed Items
 * Set up Project Board
 * Set up Visual Studio and Github Repo
 * Created initial user stories

* Complete User Stories
 * As a User I want to add tasks to each day of the week so I can stay on track
 * As a user I want to be able to add more detail to my activities so that I can change my planner when necessary 
 
 * Incomplete User Stories
  * As a User I want to be able to delete activities if my plans change so that I can keep my planner up to date 


#### Sprint 2 Retrospective 
* Made a lot more progress in the second sprint
* Following from Sprint 1 Retrospective 
  * Worked on making my user stories smaller and was able to add more functionality to GUI doing this, still more work to do on this so hoping for improvement Sprint 3
  * Sorted my GUI by splitting onto 3 windows
  * Ensured I had more breaks which helped solve problems faster
* Next Sprint I need to make sure I have a unit test for each method before moving on to the next method 

### Sprint 3

#### Sprint 3 Goal

* Add a delete function 
* Make sure there are passing Unit Tests for all the delete Methods in the CRUD Manager
* Ensure the front end is easy to navigate


#### Sprint 3 Review

* Complete User Stories
 * As a User I want to be able to delete activities if my plans change so that I can keep my planner up to date 
 
* Compete Epics
 * As a user I want to be able to see clearly what I have on this week so I can stay organized
 * As a User I want to delete or update my day on my planner so that I can keep my planner up to date
 

#### Sprint 3 Retrospective 
* Happy with completed MVP (minimal viable product) :
 * Functionality I set out to complete on GUI
 * Happy with GUI design
* Following from Sprint 2 Retrospective 
 * Completed Unit Tests as I created method this sprint
 * Continuted to think about User Stories and how to split them 

 #### Project Retrospective 
 
 What have I learnt?
 * How to incorporate all the the content from the last 6 weeks into one project 
 * How to use agile
 * How to use GitHub
 * How to stylize a GUI 
 
 What would I do differently next time?
* Add messages on the Commits explaing what they are adding/updating which User Story it completes
* Work on breaking down user stories 
* Spend more time making working methods and then immediately unit testing
* Really thinking about the Project DoD before beginning

What would I do next?
* Complete the User Stories from the sprint backlog 
 * Add Functions which allow multiple users 
 * Following from above be able to add and delete users 
 * Add accessibility levels eg a toddler cannot edit their own planner, parent would do for them, parent can edit teenagers but teen can't edit their parents
 * Add more weeks so you can plan for the following weeks 
 * Add months/ years
