### Project Retrospective


#### Sprint 1 Retrospective 
* Pleased with how my first sprint went and first time creating a 3 - Tier App
* Next Sprint I need to make sure my User Stories are smaller, take on one task at a time
* Next Sprint I need to keep my code neat, make sure I'm using all tiers and not just re-writing code
* Next Sprint sort front end, TOO MUCH going on 
* Next Sprint need to take it step my step & take breaks so I have fresh eyes 

#### Sprint 2 Retrospective 
* Made a lot more progress in the second sprint
* Following from Sprint 1 Retrospective 
  * Worked on making my user stories smaller and was able to add more functionality to GUI doing this, still more work to do on this so hoping for improvement Sprint 3
  * Sorted my GUI by splitting onto 3 windows
  * Ensured I had more breaks which helped solve problems faster
* Next Sprint I need to make sure I have a unit test for each method before moving on to the next method
