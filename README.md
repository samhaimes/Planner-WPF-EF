# Project-Repo


### Sprint 1 Retrospective 
Pleased with how my first sprint went and first time creating a 3 - Tier App
Next Sprint I need to make sure my User Stories are smaller, take on one task at a time
Next Sprint I need to keep my code neat, make sure I'm using all tiers and not just re-writing code
Next Sprint sort front end, TOO MUCH going on 
Next Sprint need to take it step my step & take breaks so I have fresh eyes
